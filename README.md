# Plant-Disease-Identification-Using-Deep-learning
📌 Overview

Plant diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity, leading to major economic losses. This project aims to develop an AI-driven plant disease detection system using VGG16, a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this system can accurately classify plant diseases from leaf images, providing early detection and aiding in better crop management.

🚀 Features

Deep Learning-based Classification: Uses VGG16 for feature extraction and classification.

Automated Image Processing: Preprocesses input images to ensure accurate disease detection.

Multi-Class Disease Identification: Supports multiple plant diseases across different species.

User-Friendly Interface: Can be integrated into web or mobile applications for farmers and researchers.

Scalable & Extendable: Can be trained on additional datasets for improved accuracy.

🔧 Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow & Keras

OpenCV (for image processing)

Flask (for web-based integration)

NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
